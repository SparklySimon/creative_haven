        <h2>Our Backstory</h2>
            <p>During our spare time, we learned origami with our parents friends. It was pretty boring at first; it basically involves folding
                a blank sheet of paper for about an entire hour. When time passes, it started to grow on us. As a result, we decided to sell our
                work for about a dollar for the whole world to appreciate. We also once invested in popsicle stick projects for the sake of either
                asthetics or utility. While it may seem more challenging, we also try painting in order to express ourselves. It was a fun thing
                to do for a hobby, and you might give it a chance someday.</p>
